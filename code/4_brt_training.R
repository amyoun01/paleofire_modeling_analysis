# 4_brt_training.R ------------------------------------------------------------------
# R version: Fire Safety (3.2.2, Released 2015-08-14)
# Operating System: Windows 7 Ultimate 64-bit (Service Pack 1)
#
# Train boosted regression tree (brt) models to predict the 30-yr probability of fire
# occurrence using mean temperature of the warmest month (TempWarm), total annual 
# precipitation (PAnn), topographic ruggedness (TR), and vegetation type (veg). There
# are four sets of models trained in this script:
#     (1) "Original" - No added fires to modify the shape of the fire-temperatue 
#                      relationship.
#     (2) "Shape1"   - A 5% increase in fire occurrences is added to the dataset to 
#                      modify the fire-temperature relationship.
#     (3) "Shape3"   - A 10% increase in fire occurrences is added to the dataset to 
#                      modify the fire-temperature relationship.
#     (4) "Shape4"   - A 25% increase in fire occurrences is added to the dataset to 
#                      modify the fire-temperature relationship.
#
# Overall, the training of these BRTs is very similar to that used in 
# Young et al. (2017), except that in this analysis the models are trained using Mean
# total annual precipitation (PAnn) instead of Mean Total Annual P-PET. See Young et 
# al. (2017, Ecography) and Young et al. (In Press, GEB) for more details.
# 
# FILE REQUIREMENTS:
#   (1) Climatologies of training data from 1950-2009. For this training data we used  
#       the same downscaled climate data set used in Young et al. (2017). Specifically,
#       this was the downscaled dataset from the Scenarios Network for Alaska and 
#       Arctic Planning. Citation provided in the README-code.txt file. Details on
#       how training data were sampled are described in Young et al. (2017). These 
#       data are located in "..\data\brt_training_data\"
#
#   (2) Vegetation and Topographic data used as explanatory variables and to help
#       generate spatial masks of the study area. Located in "..\data\vegetation_topography_data\"
#       These include the following files:
#           * AK_VEG.tif 
#           * TR.tif
#           * ecor.tif
#
# DEPENDENCIES:
#   * gbm package (version 2.1.1, Date/Publication: 2015-03-11)
#   * raster package (version 2.5.8, Date/Publication: 2016-06-02)
#   * R.utils (version 2.2.0, Date/Publication: 2015-12-11)
