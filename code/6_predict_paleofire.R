# 6_predict_paleofire.R -------------------------------------------------------------
# R version: Fire Safety (3.2.2, Released 2015-08-14)
# Operating System: Windows 7 Ultimate 64-bit (Service Pack 1)
#
# Make predictions for the 30-yr probability of fire occurrence for overlapping thirty
# year periods from 850-1850. Use the previously organized explanatory variable data
# tables (made via "5_make_paleo_dataframe.R") to inform and make these paleofire 
# predictions. Export these predictions as CSV files to be imported into MATLAB where   
# the relative prediction errors will be calculated. Here, there are 7 sets of 
# predictions for each GCM, each characterizing the predictions under different 
# sensitivity analyses. See Young et al. (In Press) for more details regarding 
# these different sensitivity analyses.
#
#     (1) "Original" - No modifications made to the fire-temperature relationship.
#     (2) "Shape1" - A 5% increase in fire occurrences is added to the dataset to 
#                    modify the fire-temperature relationship.
#     (3) "Shape2" - A 10% increase in fire occurrences is added to the dataset to 
#                    modify the fire-temperature relationship.
#     (4) "Shape3" - A 25% increase in fire occurrences is added to the dataset to 
#                    modify the fire-temperature relationship.
#     (5) "T1" - The location of the 13.4 C threshold is decreased by 0.5 deg. C.
#     (6) "T2" - The location of the 13.4 C threshold is decreased by 1.0 deg. C.
#     (7) "T3" - The location of the 13.4 C threshold is decreased by 1.5 deg. C.
#
